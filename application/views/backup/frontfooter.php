                    <h3>Mode and place of processing the Data</h3>
                    <h4>Methods of processing</h4>
                    <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
                        modification, or unauthorized
                        destruction of the Data.<br />
                        The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following
                        organizational procedures and
                        modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the
                        Data may be accessible to
                        certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Website (administration,
                        sales, marketing,
                        legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service
                        providers, mail carriers,
                        hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data
                        Processors by the Owner. The
                        updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>
                    <h4>Legal basis of processing</h4>
                    <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some
                            legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                            such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following
                            legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is
                            subject to European data protection law;</li>
                        <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for
                            any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
                        <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
                            subject;</li>
                        <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                            exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
                        <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or
                            by a third party.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                        processing, and in
                        particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or
                        a requirement necessary
                        to enter into a contract.</p>
                    <h4>Place</h4>
                    <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties
                        involved in the
                        processing are located.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a
                        country other than their
                        own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check
                        the section containing
                        details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
                    <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the
                        European Union or to
                        any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more
                        countries, such as the UN,
                        and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.</p>
                    <p>If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of
                        this document or inquire
                        with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
                    <h4>Retention time</h4>
                    <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been
                        collected for.</p>
                    <p>Therefore:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the
                            Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
                        <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be
                            retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information
                            regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this
                            document or by contacting the Owner.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
                        consent to such
                        processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to
                        retain Personal Data for
                        a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon
                        order of an authority.</p>
                    <p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to
                        access, the right to erasure,
                        the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration
                        of the retention
                        period.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h3 class="mb-1">The rights of Users</h3>
                    <p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>
                    <p>In particular, Users have the right to do the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Withdraw their consent at any time.</strong> Users have the right to withdraw

                    <h4>Details about the right to object to processing</h4>
                    <p>Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority
                        vested in the Owner or
                        for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such
                        processing by providing a
                        ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.</p>
                    <p>Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing
                        purposes, they can object to
                        that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether the Owner is
                        processing Personal Data
                        for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</p>

                        one month.</p>

                    <p>This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Website to achieve the purposes
                        described below. Such
                        technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or
                        use resources (for
                        example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Website.</p>
                    <p>For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless
                        there is a reason to
                        differentiate.<br />
                        For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate
                        to talk about Cookies in
                        the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this
                        document, the term Cookies
                        is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.</p>
                    <p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent. Whenever
                        consent is given, it can
                        be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document</p>
                    <p>This Website only uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party”
                        Trackers).<br />
                        The validity and expiration periods of first-party Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary
                        depending on the lifetime
                        set by the Owner. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.</p>
                    <h3>Activities strictly necessary for the operation of this Website and delivery of the Service</h3>
                    <p>This Website uses so-called “technical” Cookies and other similar Trackers to carry out
                        activities that are strictly
                        necessary for the operation or delivery of the Service.</p>
                    <h3>How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent</h3>
                    <p>There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to provide and withdraw consent,
                        where relevant:</p>
                    <p>Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings,
                        for example, by
                        preventing the use or storage of Trackers.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide or withdraw
                        such consent by setting
                        their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the
                        relevant
                        consent-preferences widget, if available.</p>
                    <p>It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored
                        Trackers, including those used
                        to remember the User’s initial consent.</p>
                    <p>Other Trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.</p>
                    <h4>Locating Tracker Settings</h4>
                    <p>Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used
                        browsers at the following
                        addresses:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Chrome</li>
                        <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
                        <li>Apple Safari</li>
                        <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
                        <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
                        <li>Brave</li>
                        <li>Opera</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through
                        relevant device settings,
                        such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general
                        (Users may open the device
                        settings, view and look for the relevant setting).</p>
